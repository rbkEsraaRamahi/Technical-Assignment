# Technical-Assignment

This repo has three main folders for each question. 

## ER diagram

It includes the diagram picture that I made it online by using "lucidchart.com". 

## TCL Assignment

Which has the solution for both sorting and reverse functions. for the sorting function, I choose to solve it by using Quick Sort algorithm. For the reverse function, I solve it in two ways, because I used in one of them the build function "lreverse", then I think about solve it in another way to show the logic and the syntax of the language.

### Getting Started

To show the output for all the test cases inside the file, open the command line then type

```
tclsh study.tcl
```

## RSS Parser

Here we will bring all the jobs titles from RSS and render them in client page. I used Express/Node.JS for the back end, to parse the data and send it to the front end. Kindly, find the logic in the index.js file.
For the front end I implement the page by using React.JS. Which only fetch the data from the server and show it to the client.  

### Getting Started

To show the output for the jobs, in the command line enter the RSS Parser folder then 

```
npm install
```
```
node index.js
```
Open another terminal window and enter the client folder inside the RSS Parser folder, then type the command

```
npm start
```
It will open the webpage with the jobs-location table.

### Installing

To make it work, you need to have node.js and npm in your machine.
